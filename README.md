Real time messaging service using geolocation &amp; firebase to place students in chatrooms by what building they are sitting in.

####Team guidelines
-------------------
- Please use github's 'issues' system on the right if you have .. issues.
- Communication should be mostly done via in person or on facebook.
- We are all going to be playing 'jack of all trades roles in this', learn as much of the web stack as you can!

####Team checklist
------------------
- 'Fork' this repo so you can make changes to it in order to submit 'pull' requests in the future. (Pretty much how you edit the code).
- 'Star' this repo for publicity :)
- Install the content in requirements.txt
- Get comfortable with [javascript](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_geolocation.asp) and [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), a python backend framework
- Read about [firebase](http://firebase.com), another backend framework. 

Good luck!
