==========

Real time messaging service using geolocation &amp; `node.js` and `firebase` to place students in chatrooms by what building they are sitting in. This is still a work in progress but it is my main extracirricular at the moment!

Our geolocation strategy is to call the google location api for `geocode ranges` for specific universities and buildings. After we build up a reasonable data set, we can easily call our own service for **geocoords --> human building** to decide where to place users in chat rooms.

####Team guidelines
-------------------
- Please use github's `issues` system on the right if you have .. issues.
- Communication should be mostly done via in person or on facebook.
- We are all going to be playing `jack of all trades` roles in this, learn as much of the web stack as you can!

####Team checklist
------------------
- To add code, `Fork` this repo → edit code → submit a `pull` request.
- `Star` this repo for publicity :)
- For the base of our chat app, we will be following this [tuorial](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/real-time-chat-with-nodejs-socket-io-and-expressjs/).
- Get comfortable with [javascript](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_geolocation.asp) and [node.js](http://nodejs.org), a javascript backend framework and the [express](http://expressjs.com/) templating engine.
- Read about [firebase](http://firebase.com), another backend framework. 
- Do NOT edit this README until you are familar with the markdown [`.md`](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) language.

Good luck!
