Real time messaging service using geolocation &amp; firebase to place students in chatrooms by what building they are sitting in.

####Team guidelines
-------------------
- Please use github's `issues` system on the right if you have .. issues.
- Communication should be mostly done via in person or on facebook.
- We are all going to be playing `jack of all trades` roles in this, learn as much of the web stack as you can!

####Team checklist
------------------
- To add code, `Fork` this repo → edit code → submit a `pull` request.
- `Star` this repo for publicity :)
- Install the content in requirements.txt
- Get comfortable with [javascript](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_geolocation.asp) and [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), a python backend framework
- Read about [firebase](http://firebase.com), another backend framework. 
- Do NOT edit this README until you are familar with the markdown [`.md`](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) language.

Good luck!
